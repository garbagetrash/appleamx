Apples SME precursor AMX instrutions. I have an M1 MBA and will be prioritizing
for that particular chip.

Made by staring a lot at [this repo](https://github.com/yvt/amx-rs) and
[this documentation](https://github.com/corsix/amx). The only reason I'm
redoing the repo is the linked is doing a fair bit more than I care about, and
is missing some of the things I do want like nice wrappers for the f32 FMA.
Also I tend to learn things better by simply doing them myself.
